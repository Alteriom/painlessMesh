Windows MSVC Compatibility Fix for mesh.hpp

Issue: MSVC does not grant friend status to lambdas inside friend functions.
The tcp::initServer and tcp::connect functions use lambdas that access:
- semaphoreTake()
- semaphoreGive()  
- droppedConnectionCallbacks

Solution: Make these members public for Windows compatibility.

Location: src/painlessmesh/mesh.hpp around line 2060

Change the access modifier from protected to public for the semaphore methods.
