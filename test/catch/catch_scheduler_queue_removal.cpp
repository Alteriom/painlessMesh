/**
 * Unit tests for v1.7.6 fix
 * 
 * This test verifies that the problematic scheduler_queue files have been
 * removed and are not causing compilation errors. The thread-safe scheduler
 * queue feature was removed because:
 * 
 * 1. It required _TASK_THREAD_SAFE macro to be defined
 * 2. _TASK_THREAD_SAFE conflicts with _TASK_STD_FUNCTION in TaskScheduler v4.0.x
 * 3. painlessMesh requires _TASK_STD_FUNCTION for lambda callbacks
 * 4. Result: scheduler_queue.cpp tried to compile but _task_request_t type was undefined
 * 
 * The fix maintains ~85% FreeRTOS crash reduction via semaphore timeout increase.
 * 
 * @see docs/releases/RELEASE_PLAN_v1.7.6.md
 * @see docs/troubleshooting/PAINLESSMESH_V1.7.4_COMPILATION_ISSUES.md
