## Quick Start

### For Mesh Nodes
```cpp
#include "alteriom_sensor_package.hpp"
using namespace alteriom;

// Collect and send metrics every 30 seconds
Task taskMetrics(30000, TASK_FOREVER, []() {
  MetricsPackage metrics;
  // ... populate metrics ...
  mesh.sendBroadcast(metrics.toJsonString());
});
```

### For Gateway Nodes
```cpp
#include "enhanced_mqtt_bridge.hpp"

EnhancedMqttBridge bridge(mesh, mqttClient);
bridge.begin();

// In loop()
bridge.update();
```

### MQTT Commands
```bash
# Request metrics from all nodes
mosquitto_pub -t mesh/command/request_metrics -m '{"node_id": 0}'

# Get aggregated statistics
mosquitto_pub -t mesh/command/get_aggregated -m '{}'

# Subscribe to metrics
mosquitto_sub -t mesh/metrics/#
```
