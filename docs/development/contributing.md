## Overview

There are many ways to contribute to painlessMesh:

### üêõ Report Bugs

Found a bug? [Open an issue](https://github.com/Alteriom/painlessMesh/issues/new) with:

- Hardware (ESP32/ESP8266 model)
- Library version
- Minimal code to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Debug output

### üí° Suggest Features

Have an idea? [Start a discussion](https://github.com/Alteriom/painlessMesh/discussions/new) or open an issue with:

- Clear use case
- Proposed API/interface
- Implementation considerations
- Compatibility impact

### üìù Improve Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add examples and tutorials
- Improve API documentation
- Translate documentation

See the [Documentation Guide](documentation.md) for details.

### üîß Submit Code

Contributing code:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. **Make changes**: Follow our code style
4. **Test**: Run the test suite
5. **Commit**: Use descriptive commit messages
6. **Push**: `git push origin feature/my-feature`
7. **Pull Request**: Describe your changes

### ‚úÖ Code Quality Standards

All code contributions should:

- Follow Arduino library guidelines
- Include tests where applicable
- Compile without warnings on ESP32 and ESP8266
- Include comments for complex logic
- Update documentation as needed

### üß™ Testing

Before submitting:

```bash
# Build tests
cmake -G Ninja .
ninja

# Run tests
run-parts --regex catch_ bin/

# Test Arduino examples
# Use Arduino IDE or PlatformIO to verify examples compile
```

See [Testing Guide](TESTING_SUMMARY.md) for comprehensive testing instructions.

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Development Environment

**Required Tools:**

- Git
- CMake 3.10+
- Ninja build system
- GCC/Clang compiler
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO

**Optional Tools:**

- Docker (for containerized testing)
- Python 3.6+ (for scripts)
- Node.js (for npm package development)

**Clone and Build:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alteriom/painlessMesh.git
cd painlessMesh

# Initialize submodules
git submodule update --init

# Build
cmake -G Ninja .
ninja

# Run tests
run-parts --regex catch_ bin/
```

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/broadcast-ota` - New features
- `fix/memory-leak` - Bug fixes
- `docs/mqtt-guide` - Documentation
- `refactor/clean-api` - Code improvements
- `test/coverage-boost` - Test additions

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
type(scope): brief description

Longer explanation if needed.

Fixes #123
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style (formatting)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Tests
- `chore`: Build/tooling

**Examples:**

```
feat(ota): add broadcast OTA distribution

Implements chunk-based OTA distribution across mesh network
with 98% traffic reduction for large meshes.

Fixes #42
```

```
fix(mqtt): correct topic sanitization

Node IDs with special characters were causing MQTT
subscription failures. Now properly escapes characters.

Fixes #56
```

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### ESP32

- Memory: ~320KB RAM available
- Use PSRAM where available
- Test with WiFi library v2.0.0+
- Consider dual-core implications

### ESP8266

- Memory: ~80KB RAM (limited!)
- Be extra careful with memory allocation
- Test with Arduino Core 3.0.0+
- Avoid large stack allocations

## Code Style

### C++ Style

- Use 2-space indentation
- Opening braces on same line
- Use `camelCase` for functions
- Use `PascalCase` for classes
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants

### Arduino Conventions

- Provide `.ino` examples
- Use `setup()` and `loop()` pattern
- Include helpful Serial output
- Add comments explaining hardware setup

### Header Guards

```cpp
#ifndef PAINLESSMESH_FEATURE_HPP
#define PAINLESSMESH_FEATURE_HPP

// Code here

#endif // PAINLESSMESH_FEATURE_HPP
```
