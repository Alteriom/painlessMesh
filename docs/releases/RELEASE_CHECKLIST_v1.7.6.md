## üîÑ Manual Steps Required

### 1. Create GitHub Release

**URL:** https://github.com/Alteriom/painlessMesh/releases/new

**Release Details:**
- **Tag:** v1.7.6 (select existing tag)
- **Title:** `v1.7.6 - Critical Compilation Fix`
- **Set as latest release:** ‚úÖ Checked

**Release Description Template:**

```markdown
# v1.7.6 - Critical Compilation Fix

üö® **URGENT**: If you are using v1.7.4 or v1.7.5, upgrade immediately. Those versions fail to compile.

## What's Fixed

‚úÖ **Compilation Failure** - Fixed "_task_request_t was not declared" error  
‚úÖ **ESP32 Support** - All ESP32 builds now compile successfully  
‚úÖ **ESP8266 Support** - All ESP8266 builds now compile successfully  
‚úÖ **FreeRTOS Stability** - Maintained ~85% crash reduction on ESP32  

## What Changed

This release removes the thread-safe scheduler queue that was causing compilation failures:

- **Removed**: `scheduler_queue.hpp` and `scheduler_queue.cpp`
- **Simplified**: `mesh.hpp` initialization code
- **Maintained**: Semaphore timeout fix for FreeRTOS crash protection

## Why This Fix

The thread-safe scheduler queue required `_TASK_THREAD_SAFE` macro, but:
- This macro conflicts with `_TASK_STD_FUNCTION` in TaskScheduler v4.0.x
- painlessMesh **requires** `_TASK_STD_FUNCTION` for lambda callbacks
- The queue code was disabled but still trying to compile
- Result: Type definitions were missing, causing compilation errors

## Upgrade Instructions

### PlatformIO
```ini
[env:your_board]
lib_deps =
    https://github.com/Alteriom/painlessMesh.git#v1.7.6
```

### Arduino IDE
Update through Library Manager: **AlteriomPainlessMesh v1.7.6**

### NPM
```bash
npm update @alteriom/painlessmesh
```

## Performance

- ‚úÖ ESP32 crash rate: ~5-8% (down from 30-40%)
- ‚úÖ Crash reduction: ~85% via semaphore timeout increase
- ‚úÖ No performance impact vs v1.7.2
- ‚úÖ Full lambda and std::function support maintained

## Testing

- ‚úÖ 710+ unit tests passing
- ‚úÖ All 19 examples compile successfully
- ‚úÖ ESP32 and ESP8266 platforms verified
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline passing

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a pure bug fix release.

## Known Limitations

- ESP32 crash protection is ~85% effective (not 95-98% as originally targeted)
- Thread-safe scheduler queue feature removed (may return in v1.8.0)
- Requires TaskScheduler v4.1+ for future thread-safe re-implementation

### 2. Publish NPM Package

**Prerequisites:**
- NPM account with publish access
- Logged in to NPM (`npm whoami` to verify)

**Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Verify login
npm whoami

# 2. (Optional) Test package creation
npm pack

# 3. Publish to NPM
npm publish --access public

# 4. Verify publication
npm view @alteriom/painlessmesh version
# Should show: 1.7.6
```

**NPM Package URL:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alteriom/painlessmesh

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Logged in to NPM
- [ ] Package built successfully
- [ ] Published to NPM registry
- [ ] Version 1.7.6 visible on npmjs.com
- [ ] Installation tested: `npm install @alteriom/painlessmesh@1.7.6`

---

### 3. Monitor PlatformIO Registry

**URL:** https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/sparck75/AlteriomPainlessMesh

**Update Process:**
- **Automatic:** PlatformIO scans GitHub releases every 24 hours
- **Expected:** v1.7.6 should appear within 24 hours of GitHub Release
- **Manual Trigger (if needed):** `pio pkg publish .`

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Wait 24 hours after GitHub Release
- [ ] Verify v1.7.6 appears on registry
- [ ] Test installation: `pio pkg install --library "AlteriomPainlessMesh@1.7.6"`
- [ ] Verify example compilation
