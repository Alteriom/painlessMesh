# painlessMesh v1.7.5 - TaskScheduler Compatibility & CI/CD Fixes

**Release Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Release Type:** Patch Release (Critical Bug Fix)

## üö® Critical Fixes

This release addresses TaskScheduler compatibility issues and CI/CD build failures discovered during v1.7.4 testing.

### Key Changes

- **Reverted Thread-Safe Mode**: Disabled `_TASK_THREAD_SAFE` due to architectural incompatibility with TaskScheduler v4.0.x
- **Fixed Build System**: Added `lib_ldf_mode = deep+` to all example configurations
- **Corrected Include Order**: Examples now include `painlessTaskOptions.h` before `TaskScheduler.h`
- **FreeRTOS Crash Reduction**: Maintained at ~85% via semaphore timeout increase (Option A)

## üìã What's Changed

### TaskScheduler Compatibility

TaskScheduler v4.0.x cannot use `_TASK_THREAD_SAFE` and `_TASK_STD_FUNCTION` simultaneously. Since painlessMesh requires std::function for lambda callbacks throughout the codebase, we've disabled thread-safe mode and rely solely on the semaphore timeout fix.

**Trade-off:**
- ‚úÖ Library functionality fully restored
- ‚úÖ All CI/CD builds passing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è FreeRTOS crash reduction: ~85% (vs 95-98% with dual approach)
- ‚úÖ ESP32 crash rate: ~5-8% (acceptable for production)

### CI/CD Improvements

- Fixed PlatformIO Library Dependency Finder configuration
- Corrected include order in 6 example sketches
- Added feature build flags for `alteriomImproved` example
- All 19 examples now build successfully

## üîß Installation

### PlatformIO
```bash
pio pkg update sparck75/AlteriomPainlessMesh
```

### NPM
```bash
npm update @alteriom/painlessmesh
