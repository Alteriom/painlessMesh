## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Recommendations

1. **Start Conservative** - Begin with 60s intervals and adjust based on needs
2. **Monitor Memory** - Watch heap usage when enabling new features
3. **Test Thoroughly** - Validate in your specific environment
4. **Use Aggregation** - Enable aggregated stats for large meshes
5. **Set Up Alerts** - Configure critical health alerting
6. **Track Trends** - Use memoryTrend to detect slow leaks

### Known Limitations

- **Cache Size:** Limited to 20 nodes by default (configurable)
- **Memory Trend:** Requires multiple samples for accuracy
- **Timestamp:** Uses mesh time, may need NTP integration
- **Problem Detection:** Thresholds may need tuning for your use case

### Future Enhancements (Planned for v1.8.0)

- Compressed metric packages for large meshes
- Historical trend storage in gateway
- Automatic threshold tuning
- Machine learning-based failure prediction
- Cloud monitoring service integration
- Configurable health scoring algorithms
