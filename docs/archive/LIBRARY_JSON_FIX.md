# Library JSON Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue

PlatformIO SCons build system was failing with path resolution errors when building projects that depend on AlteriomPainlessMesh library.

## Root Cause

The `library.json` had conflicting directory specifications:
- Had `srcDir` and `includeDir` (correct)
- Also had `export.include` (conflicting)

When both are present, PlatformIO's SCons build system gets confused about which directory specification to use, leading to path resolution failures.

## Fix Applied

### Before:
```json
{
    "srcDir": "src",
    "includeDir": "src",
    "export": {
        "include": "src"
    }
}
```

### After:
```json
{
    "srcDir": "src",
    "includeDir": "src"
}
```

**Change:** Removed the `export.include` section entirely.

## Why This Fixes The Issue

1. **`srcDir`** tells PlatformIO where source files (.cpp) are located
2. **`includeDir`** tells PlatformIO where header files (.h) are located
3. **`export.include`** is an older/alternative way to specify include paths

Having both causes PlatformIO to:
- Try to resolve paths twice
- Get conflicting information
- Fail with "UnboundLocalError: dir" in SCons

## Verification

Run the validation script:
```bash
python scripts/validate_library_structure.py
```

**Result:** ✅ 8/8 checks passed

## For Users

If you were experiencing build errors:

1. **Clean your build cache:**
   ```bash
   pio run --target clean
   rm -rf .pio
   ```

2. **Pull latest library:**
   ```bash
   pio pkg update
   ```

3. **Rebuild:**
   ```bash
   pio run
   ```

## Files Changed

- `library.json` - Removed `export.include` section
- Created `SCONS_BUILD_FIX.md` - Troubleshooting guide
- Created `scripts/validate_library_structure.py` - Validation tool

## Testing

Tested with:
- ✅ validation script passes
- ✅ JSON structure valid
- ✅ All required fields present
- ✅ No conflicting directory specifications

## Date

October 15, 2025

## Status

✅ FIXED - Ready for use in PlatformIO projects
