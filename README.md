- **Configuration Management** - Query and update node configurations remotely
- **Status Monitoring** - Receive real-time status updates and sensor data via MQTT
- **Event Notifications** - Track node connections, disconnections, and mesh topology changes

**Documentation:**

See [mqttBridge example](examples/mqttBridge/) for MQTT integration.

**Examples:**

- 🌉 [MQTT Bridge](examples/mqttBridge/mqttBridge.ino) - Gateway bridge with bidirectional MQTT-mesh routing
- 📡 [Alteriom Sensor Node](examples/alteriom/alteriom.ino) - Example node using SensorPackage, CommandPackage, and StatusPackage

### 🌐 Core Features

The library handles routing and network management automatically, so you can focus on your application. It uses JSON-based messaging and syncs time across all nodes, making it ideal for coordinated behaviour like synchronized light displays or sensor networks reporting to a central node. The original version was forked from [easymesh](https://github.com/Coopdis/easyMesh).

### True ad-hoc networking

painlessMesh is a true ad-hoc network, meaning that no-planning, central controller, or router is required. Any system of 1 or more nodes will self-organize into fully functional mesh. The maximum size of the mesh is limited (we think) by the amount of memory in the heap that can be allocated to the sub-connections buffer and so should be really quite high.

### JSON based

painlessMesh uses JSON objects for all its messaging. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, it makes the code and the messages human readable and painless to understand and second, it makes it painless to integrate painlessMesh with javascript front-ends, web applications, and other apps. Some performance is lost, but I haven’t been running into performance issues yet. Converting to binary messaging would be fairly straight forward if someone wants to contribute.

### Wifi &amp; Networking

painlessMesh is designed to be used with Arduino, but it does not use the Arduino WiFi libraries, as we were running into performance issues (primarily latency) with them. Rather the networking is all done using the native esp32 and esp8266 SDK libraries, which are available through the Arduino IDE. Hopefully though, which networking libraries are used won’t matter to most users much as you can just include painlessMesh.h, run the init() and then work the library through the API.

### painlessMesh is not IP networking

painlessMesh does not create a TCP/IP network of nodes. Rather each of the nodes is uniquely identified by its 32bit chipId which is retrieved from the esp8266/esp32 using the `system_get_chip_id()` call in the SDK. Every node will have a unique number. Messages can either be broadcast to all the nodes on the mesh, or sent specifically to an individual node which is identified by its `nodeId.

### Limitations and caveats

- Try to avoid using `delay()` in your code. To maintain the mesh we need to perform some tasks in the background. Using `delay()` will stop these tasks from happening and can cause the mesh to lose stability/fall apart. Instead, we recommend using [TaskScheduler](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/TaskScheduler) which is used in `painlessMesh` itself. Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/arkhipenko/TaskScheduler/wiki/Full-Document). For other examples on how to use the scheduler see the example folder.
- `painlessMesh` subscribes to WiFi events. Please be aware that as a result `painlessMesh` can be incompatible with user programs/other libraries that try to bind to the same events.
- Try to be conservative in the number of messages (and especially broadcast messages) you sent per minute. This is to prevent the hardware from overloading. Both esp8266 and esp32 are limited in processing power/memory, making it easy to overload the mesh and destabilize it. And while `painlessMesh` tries to prevent this from happening, it is not always possible to do so.
- Messages can go missing or be dropped due to high traffic and you can not rely on all messages to be delivered. One suggestion to work around is to resend messages every so often. Even if some go missing, most should go through. Another option is to have your nodes send replies when they receive a message. The sending nodes can the resend the message if they haven’t gotten a reply in a certain amount of time.

## Installation

### Arduino Library Manager

**Once registered**, installation will be available via Arduino IDE:

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to **Tools** → **Manage Libraries...**
3. Search for **"AlteriomPainlessMesh"**
4. Click **Install**

The library includes the header file `AlteriomPainlessMesh.h` which provides access to both the core painlessMesh functionality and Alteriom-specific extensions.

#### Manual Installation (Current Method)

**Option 1: Download ZIP from GitHub Release**

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Alteriom/painlessMesh/releases/latest)
2. Download the latest release ZIP file
3. In Arduino IDE: **Sketch** → **Include Library** → **Add .ZIP Library...**
4. Select the downloaded ZIP file
5. Restart Arduino IDE

**Option 2: Git Clone**

```bash
cd ~/Arduino/libraries/
git clone https://github.com/Alteriom/painlessMesh.git AlteriomPainlessMesh
# Restart Arduino IDE
```

### PlatformIO

`painlessMesh` is included in both the Arduino Library Manager and the platformio library registry and can easily be installed via either of those methods.

### Dependencies

painlessMesh makes use of the following libraries, which can be installed through the Arduino Library Manager

- [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)
- [TaskScheduler](https://github.com/arkhipenko/TaskScheduler)
- [ESPAsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP) (ESP8266)
- [AsyncTCP](https://github.com/ESP32Async/AsyncTCP) (ESP32) - v3.3.0+ required for ESP32-C6

If platformio is used to install the library, then the dependencies will be installed automatically.

## Quick Start with Alteriom Packages

### Basic Sensor Node

```cpp
#include "painlessMesh.h"

#define MESH_PREFIX "whateverYouLike"
#define MESH_PASSWORD "somethingSneaky"
#define MESH_PORT 5555

Scheduler userScheduler;
painlessMesh mesh;

Task taskSendMessage(TASK_SECOND * 30, TASK_FOREVER, []() {
  String msg = "Hello from node ";
  msg += mesh.getNodeId();
  mesh.sendBroadcast(msg);
});

void receivedCallback(uint32_t from, String &msg) {
  Serial.printf("Received from %u: %s\n", from, msg.c_str());
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  mesh.init(MESH_PREFIX, MESH_PASSWORD, &userScheduler, MESH_PORT);
  mesh.onReceive(&receivedCallback);
  userScheduler.addTask(taskSendMessage);
  taskSendMessage.enable();
}

void loop() {
  mesh.update();
}
```

### Bridge to Internet (Auto Channel Detection)

The new bridge-centric architecture makes it easy to connect your mesh to the Internet via a router. The bridge node automatically detects the router's channel and configures the mesh accordingly.

#### Bridge Node

```cpp
#include "painlessMesh.h"

#define MESH_PREFIX     "MyMeshNetwork"
#define MESH_PASSWORD   "somethingSneaky"
#define ROUTER_SSID     "YourRouterSSID"
#define ROUTER_PASSWORD "YourRouterPassword"

Scheduler userScheduler;
painlessMesh mesh;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  mesh.setDebugMsgTypes(ERROR | STARTUP | CONNECTION);
  
  // Single call does everything:
  // 1. Connects to router and detects its channel
  // 2. Initializes mesh on detected channel
  // 3. Sets node as root/bridge
  mesh.initAsBridge(MESH_PREFIX, MESH_PASSWORD,
                    ROUTER_SSID, ROUTER_PASSWORD,
                    &userScheduler, 5555);
  
  mesh.onReceive(&receivedCallback);
}

void loop() { mesh.update(); }

void receivedCallback(uint32_t from, String& msg) {
  // Forward mesh data to Internet services (MQTT, HTTP, etc.)
}
```

#### Regular Nodes (Auto Channel Detection)

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  
  // channel=0 means auto-detect the mesh channel
  mesh.init(MESH_PREFIX, MESH_PASSWORD, &userScheduler, 5555, 
            WIFI_AP_STA, 0);
  
  mesh.onReceive(&receivedCallback);
}
```

See [BRIDGE_TO_INTERNET.md](BRIDGE_TO_INTERNET.md) for complete documentation.

### Message Types

painlessMesh uses two categories of message types:

## Contributing

We try to follow the [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) development model. Which means that we have a `develop` branch and `main` branch. All development is done under feature branches, which are (when finished) merged into the development branch. When a new version is released we merge the `develop` branch into the `main` branch. For more details see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Funding

If you like the library please consider supporting its development. Your contributions help me spend more time improving painlessMesh.

#include "painlessMesh.h"

painlessMesh mesh;

// Initialize mesh
mesh.init(MESH_PREFIX, MESH_PASSWORD, &userScheduler, MESH_PORT);

// Main loop - call this in loop()
mesh.update();

// Send messages
mesh.sendBroadcast("Hello everyone!");
mesh.sendSingle(nodeId, "Hello specific node");

// Get information
uint32_t myId = mesh.getNodeId();
std::list<uint32_t> nodes = mesh.getNodeList();

// Register callbacks
mesh.onReceive(&receivedCallback);
mesh.onNewConnection(&newConnectionCallback);
mesh.onChangedConnections(&changedConnectionCallback);
